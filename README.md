PhysRig is a differentiable, physics-based skinning and rigging framework that enables **realistic deformation** of articulated 3D objects. Unlike traditional methods like Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), PhysRig embeds skeletons into a deformable soft-body volume simulated using **Material Point Method (MPM)** â€” capturing the behavior of soft tissues, tails, ears, and other elastic structures in a physically plausible way.

## ðŸ§  Highlights

- **Differentiable Physics-Based Simulation**  
  Deformations are modeled using MPM and continuum mechanics, supporting gradient-based optimization of both motion and material properties.

- **Material Prototypes**  
  Learnable elastic parameter templates (Youngâ€™s modulus & Poissonâ€™s ratio) provide expressive yet compact material modeling.

- **Driving Point Rigging**  
  Instead of bone transformations, PhysRig uses velocity-driven embedded points to induce dynamic shape changes.

- **Strong Performance**  
  Outperforms LBS on both user studies and geometric metrics (Chamfer Distance), with better convergence and physical realism.

- **Applications**  
  - Inverse Skinning (from motion to parameters)  
  - Pose Transfer (e.g., human â†’ jellyfish)  
  - 4D Reconstruction & Animation
